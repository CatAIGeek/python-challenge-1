# python-challenge-1
Module 2 Challenge
This challenge is an exercise to demonstrate the development of a menue and the coding techniques used to create it.
Code Source: I am new to codeing and python and therefore used all samples from classroom activites (which were instructed by Ryan Norman). I also used BCS X-pert to assist in creating code lines throughout the document.
