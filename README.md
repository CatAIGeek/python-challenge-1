Module 2 Challenge
This challenge is an exercise to demonstrate the ability to design an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills learned in Python so far.
Part of the challenge was to use starter code provided for a menu and adapt it to allow customers to place orders, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. 
Being new to coding and not doing well on the first attempt, I decided to check with BCS Learning Assisants to ensure that I'm on the right track, especially since I've never heard or "loops" before and must them in the menue, along with "exit" code to prevent the loop from trapping the customer in an infinite loop.
Althought I didn't do well on the first assignment, I now have a better understanding of the requirements of Challenge 2.
