Module 2 Challenge

This challenge is an exercise to demonstrate the ability to design an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills learned in Python so far.
Part of the challenge was to use starter code provided for a menu and adapt it to allow customers to place orders, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. 
Being new to coding and not doing well on the first attempt, I decided to check with BCS Learning Assisants and available tutors to explain some of the questions I had conderning the for-loop and if statements.  Those areas were especially tricky for me as a noncoder being introduced to Python.  

I hope that this tool will be useful to anyone seeking examples of how to write simple code designed for an interactive ordering system.  Thank you for your time and attention to this project.
